# Landing-Page

The Landing page learned through the Odin Project!

The Live Site: https://amith-george.github.io/Landing-Page/

This project includes giving information about myself, Amith George.
It involves using purely HTML and CSS, and a lot of CSS. This was pretty fun to figure out and it was really painful but still fun to work around flexbox. 
Hope you have fun looking through the code for this site! And let's keep on learning through Odin Project!
